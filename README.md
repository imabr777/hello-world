# hello-world
Hello, my name is Abraham Im.
I'm a beginner programmer with some experience working with Java, HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL.
I'm hoping to learn C++ and/or C#, Javascript, and Python in the near future.
In my free time I normally like to play my guitar and piano, shoot my bow, and browse Reddit.
In the long run, it would be nice if I could possibly land a job programming. I realize this will require dedicated practice on my part, since I'm not a CS student, but it seems like fun, especially if I work in the video game industry.
I would like to write and release my own songs sometime in the future, when I have the time and money to do so. If I find I can't find the resources to do it of decent quality, I suppose I could just release mediocre quality recordings just to get my ideas out there.
Anyway, there's not much else to tell. Thanks for reading this.
-Abraham Im
